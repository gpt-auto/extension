This is a placeholder for the icon128.png file.

To create a proper icon, you'll need to:
1. Create a 128x128 pixel PNG image 
2. Save it as icon128.png in the images folder
3. You should also create 16x16 and 48x48 versions (icon16.png and icon48.png)

For a temporary solution, you can use any square image and resize it accordingly, or download free icons from sites like:
